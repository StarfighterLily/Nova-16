# Phase 5: Validation & Release Tasks

## Overview
Final validation and release preparation. The endpoint is a fully tested, documented migration ready for production.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Full Test Suite**
   - Validate output, graphics, sound, etc.
   - Document any failures and fixes.
   - Output: Test report with pass/fail status.

2. **User Acceptance**
   - Test complex programs (e.g., `starfield.asm`, `gfxtest.asm`).
   - Ensure no regressions in functionality.
   - Gather feedback on new syntax.
   - Output: Acceptance report.

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Review all docs/ for completeness on new system.
   - Update README.md with migration notes.
   - Ensure consistency across files.
   - Output: Finalized documentation.

4. **Release Notes**
   - Document all changes, benefits, and migration steps.
   - Include breaking changes and compatibility notes.
   - Prepare for repository update.
   - Output: Release notes file.

## Risk Mitigation
- Final backup of entire codebase.
- Rollback plan if validation fails.

## Timeline
1 day.

## Endpoint Verification
- All programs run successfully.
- Documentation is complete and accurate.
- Release notes ready for distribution.
