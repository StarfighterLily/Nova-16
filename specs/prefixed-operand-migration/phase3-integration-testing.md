# Phase 3: Integration & Testing Tasks

## Overview
Integrate changes and test thoroughly. The endpoint is validated execution of new instructions with no performance degradation.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Test Assembler with Sample Programs**
   - Convert simple programs (e.g., `asm/simple_test.asm`) to new syntax.
   - Assemble and compare binary sizes/output.
   - Fix any parsing errors in assembler.
   - Output: Working new-format binaries from samples.

2. **Debug Integration**
   - Use `nova_debugger.py` to step through new instructions.
   - Verify mode byte parsing and operand fetching.
   - Debug any CPU decoder issues.
   - Output: Debugger logs confirming correct execution.

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Measure execution time and cycles.
   - Ensure <5% slowdown; optimize if needed.
   - Output: Benchmark report with comparisons.

## Risk Mitigation
- Run tests in isolated environment.
- Revert changes if performance drops significantly.

## Timeline
2-3 days.

## Endpoint Verification
- All sample programs run correctly in new format.
- No performance regression.
- Debugger shows accurate mode parsing.
